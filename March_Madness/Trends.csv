"Since the 2008 NCAA tournament, only 5 Final Four teams have ranked outside the top 45 in adjusted defense that season.",7 or 10 seeds better overall on T Rank are 38 - 18.,At least one top four seed loses in the first round. Only once in the past 14 tournaments has this not happened. It has not happened 5 times in the past 37 tournaments. ,"Teams that lose their first conference tournament game have never won the championship. Taking it a step even further, any team that fails to advance past the quarterfinals in their conference tournament has never won the championship. ","Since 2007, only nine teams shooting under 33 % from 3 have made it to the Elite 8. Those nine teams that made it to the Elite 8 or beyond give up a lower % of threes than they shoot or close to it. No team has won a championship shooting under 33 % regardless.  ","There has not been a repeat champion since Florida in 2006 - 2007. Since then, no defending champion has advanced past the Sweet 16. In the past 5 tournaments, Virginia lost in the first round and the other four teams lost in the second round. "
"In the last 14 tournaments, only 7 teams ranked outside of top 20 in adjusted offense made it to the final four. ",1 and 2 seeds against 7 - 10 seeds are 37 - 10 when their adjusted defense ranks outside of the top 20. ,"Since the tournament expanded to 68 teams and implemented the First Four in 2011, one of the teams to advance from that preliminary section of the bracket won a Round of 64 too until 2019. Both Belmont and Arizona State were eliminated in the Round of 64. ",Xavier (2017) is the only Big East team not named Villanova to make the Elite Eight.   ,1 - 4 seeds that score 73 PPG or less have only one championship (Virginia 2019). 14 made the Final Four and the other 74 teams were eliminated before that.   ,"Going back to 2003, every final four team, except two, had a road victory % of over 50 %."
8 out of the past 14 champions were ranked number 1 in KenPom. 9 of them made at least the finals and 10 of them made at least the Final Four.  ,"Since 2008, single digit seeds that are “in the red” in terms of turnovers are 3 - 25 when it comes to making the Sweet 16 or beyond. ","Two of the last 36 tournaments have included zero double digit seeds in the Sweet 16 and only four have included four or more double digit seeds. One appears 9 times, two appears nine times, and three appears 13 times. ",The Big Ten has received 18 bids in the tournament over the last two seasons and only one of those teams has made the Elite Eight.     ,"137 teams have been a 1 - 4 seed and come into the tournament with a 15 + scoring margin. 55 made the Final Four, and 20 won the championship. ","Since 2008, only one champion has been ranked below the 50th percentile for TOV % (2014 Connecticut). Only four teams made the final four or beyond were below the 50th percentile for TOV % and TOV % D. The only team that made the finals was 2014 Kentucky."
The past 19 out of 20 champions were top 20 in adjusted offense and top 45 in adjusted defense. ,"Since 2016, 1 - 10 seeds that have an adjusted offense ranking that is 36 or more spots away from their adjusted offense away ranking are 2 - 22 when it comes to making the Sweet 16 and beyond. There have been 12 first round exits, 10 second round exits, 1 Sweet 16 (Texas Tech 2022), and 1 Final Four appearance (Auburn 2019). ","Since 1985, teams that are a 1 or 2 seed and reside in the top 10 of the AP poll after entering the season unranked have NEVER made the final four. 34 teams fit this profile. 53 % of them did not survive the first two rounds. 63.6 % of 2 seeds did not make it past the first two rounds. Specifically, 3 teams lost in the first round, 15 teams lost in the second round, 9 teams lost in the Sweet 16, and 7 teams lost in the Elite 8. Specifically, 3 teams lost in the first round, 15 teams lost in the second round, 9 teams lost in the Sweet 16, and 7 teams lost in the Elite 8.    ","Since 1991, all but one champion came from a Power Conference (ACC, Big 12, Big East, Big Ten, PAC 12, SEC). ","172 teams have been a 1 - 4 seed and come into the tournament with a scoring margin under 10. 2 have won a championship, and 12 have gone to the Final Four. Most of the teams in recent history have been first or second round exits.  ","All but two of the past 29 champions were ranked no worse than 12th in the AP Poll seven weeks before the tournament began. If they slip outside of the top 12 in the following weeks, they can still win the tournament. There have been three championship winners that were ranked top 12 seven weeks before the tournament began, but slipped outside of the top 12 leading up to the tournament. All three of those teams won their conference tournament.     "
